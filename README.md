# OPTICAL
OPTICAL Predictor
This is a Matlab based predictor and requires Matlab 2018a or latest Matlab version that supports LSTM networks. The following m-files: CSP.m, LDA.m and valErrorFun.m needs to be in the same folder as the OPTICAL.m file or can be added to your Matlab path.

The code can be used for research purpose only. Any work resulting from the use of this code should cite our original paper "Brain wave 
classification using long short-term memory network based OPTICAL predictor" published in Scientific Reports in June, 2019
