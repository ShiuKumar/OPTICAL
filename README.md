# OPTICAL
OPTICAL Predictor
This is a Matlab based predictor and requires Matlab 2018a or latest Matlab version that supports LSTM networks. The following m-files: CSP.m, LDA.m and valErrorFun.m needs to be in the same folder as the OPTICAL.m file or can be added to your Matlab path. The example_code.m file can be used to see the OPTICAL predictor being trained and used to predict the output class using the sample data (sample_data.mat and Actual_class.mat files) which can be downloaded from the following link: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/hdr7v2art9mz1px/AAAoF9Z1qQsnl3_dSiZtLoi1a?dl=0. Alternatively, download all the files at the given link and run the example_code.m file. 

The code can be used for research purpose only. Any work resulting from the use of this code should cite our original paper "Brain wave 
classification using long short-term memory network based OPTICAL predictor" published in Scientific Reports in June, 2019
